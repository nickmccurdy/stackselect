[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nickmccurdy/stackselect.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nickmccurdy/stackselect)

Simplify technology decisions with developer-friendly quizzes.

## Goals

- Automate asking people for advice about what tech to use.
- Fight the catch 22 problem of picking the wrong technology to learn because you donâ€™t understand its strengths and weaknesses compared to alternatives.
- All quizzes result in a free, open source, and well supported technology.

## [Quizzes](src/quizzes.json)

StackSelect is in the early planning/design phase as we decide how to structure quizzes and what content to include. We are happy to accept contributions to improve accuracy of existing quizzes and add more information in new and eixsting quizzes.
